                <p id="destaque">“Afeiçoa-te” is a mobile app that aims to be a bridge between sheltered animals and adopters.</p>
                <p>During this project it was essential to guarantee that the adoptions that would come from the app were conscious and responsible and not fruit of the adopter’s impulsive desires. With that in mind, the adoption process on the application consists in two phases: The first one tests the ability and fitness of the adopter to have an animal in the long-term, and the second one aims to match the adopter with animals that fit their profile. This is because different animals require different needs from their owners.</p>
                <p>The app aims to teach the adopters everything there is to know about having a pet so they are ready to care for their forever companion.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>It is estimated that every year in Portugal 30.000 animals are abandoned. From these, only 35% find a new family. <a target="_blank" href="https://sicnoticias.pt/pais/2021-08-18-Cerca-de-30.000-animais-sao-abandonados-por-ano-2d8295d1">(Sic Notícias, 2021)</a> The pandemic crises aggravated the economic situation of a lot of families, reflecting in the increase of animal abandonment, between 10% and 30%. Furthermore, the associations are overcrowded and unable to answer to the demand of wandering animals that need rescue. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.publico.pt/2021/02/20/p3/noticia/ha-animais-orfaos-faltam-maos-ajudar-1951475">(Lusa, february, 2021)</a> Adoption not only gives an abandoned animal another chance in life, but also allows the animal shelters to free a space that can be occupied by another animal in need.
                </p>
                <p>If in Portugal the pandemic crises increased the animal abandonment, the lockdown and its solitude also led to an increase in adoption requests. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jn.pt/nacional/pedidos-para-adotar-animais-dispararam-com-a-pandemia-12140959.html">(Costa A., 2020)</a>Therefore, there is an increase in the interest of the portuguese population to adopt animals.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>In the adoption process there are two parties involved: the adopter and the institution that shelters the animal. It was important to understand both of their perspectives and involvement in this process.

                <div id="textOne">
                    <p>Leonor is a student in the Faculty of Economy of the University of Porto. She lives with her parents in Matosinhos, and depends on them financially.</p>
                    <p> She wants to add a cat to her family, but she never had a pet before and doesn’t know what it implies. However, she feels ready to be responsible for it. She wants to adopt and not shop, but isn’t familiar with the adoption process.</p>
                    <p> Leonor talked with her parents about her wish to adopt and convinced them to accept a cat in their family. Leonor’s parents don’t mind paying the costs inherent to having a pet, but are apprehensive about adding a pet to their home.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="textTwo">
                    <p>She wants to adopt a cat to give it another chance at life, for empathy but also to have a new company. She isn’t looking for specific characteristics in the cat. She doesn’t exclude the possibility of adopting an animal with disability or disease, that will need extra care. However, she doesn’t want an agressive cat, that isn’t sociable, since she doesn’t have any experience with cats and doesn’t believe she’s fit to integrate it with her family.</p>
                    <p>Through friends, Leonor found the social media of some associations, however she doesn’t want to limit herself by visiting just a few animals. She believes that when she adopts her cat, it will be because she felt a strong emotional connection with it.</p>

                <p>Leonor wants to adopt a cat so she installs the app. Since she doesn’t know much about the implications of having a cat, she uses it to learn. </p>

                <h4><img id="circle" src="img/circulo.png" alt="Círculo">Match</h4>
                <p>Leonor feels ready to adopt. She opens the app in search of a cat that matches with her. She is matched with several cats, and although it’s a tough choice, she chooses the oldest cat because she knows it’ll have an easier adaptation to its new home. </p>

                <h4><img id="circle" src="img/circulo.png" alt="Círculo">Adopt</h4>
                <p>Leonor shows her parents the cat that she picked and explains to them the several steps they’ll have to take before they can bring it home. Together they decided to go through with the adoption. Leonor uses the app to contact the institution where the animal is.</p>

                <h4><img id="circle" src="img/circulo.png" alt="Círculo">Post Adoption</h4>
                <p>Leonor already has her new companion with her. However, she still uses the app to send pictures to the institution where the cat was, so they can follow up on the adoption.</p>

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>With this research it was understood that there are several phases that Leonor has to go through in the app: first she has to take an adoption ability test, so the institutions are sure she’s ready to adopt, then she has to take a matching questionnaire, since different animals require different needs from their owners. Afterwards she chooses one animal from five that matched with her and can start the adoption process.</p>
            <p> It was also understood that Leonor has to have access to the adoption guide at any given phase, and not just in the beginning of this journey.</p>
            <p> To guarantee consistency, the home page will always have the same structure and the only thing that will change is the action performed by the main button, depending to the current adoption phase the user is in. </p>

                <p>The project was tested with five potential users. During the tests it was comprehended that there were needed changes. </p>
                <p>For instance, <b>a progress bar is needed</b> so the user doesn’t worry about loosing their progress, reassuring them that it is saved. </p>
                <p>In terms of the adoption test, it was comprehended that it should be more fluid, allowing the user to have a <b>full view of everything they need to do or know before adopting</b>, so they can prepare for it in a single moment, instead of bit by bit.</p>
                <p>It was also understood that the navigation between the different matched animals would have to be possible through <b>swipping.</b></p>
                <p>Furthermore, it was understood that <b>the decision to choose an animal can’t be made inside the aplication.</b> The main reason for that is that the user needs to have an opportunity to meet the different animals in person before making a decision.</p>

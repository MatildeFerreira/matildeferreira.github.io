                        <em>Anathema</em> is a gamified mobile app developed in collaboration with Fraunhofer AICOS to enhance young adults' sexual health. While Fraunhofer's original and parent project targeted a different audience, both aimed to improve couples' sexual health. Throughout the project, we received valuable mentorship from Dr. Ana Barros and Joana Couto from&nbsp;Fraunhofer‑AICOS.                    </p>

                        An interview was conducted with Doctor Raquel Pereira, from the SexLab of the Faculty of Psychology and Education Science of the University of Porto to better understand the context of sex therapy.                    </p>

                        With the interview we understood that our target audience should be couples between <b>25 and 35 years old</b>.

As a consequence of the pandemic, the normalization of remote working has disturbed their relationship, making it repetitive and monotonous.

                                Joana and Bernardo both had an exhausting day of remote working, full of meetings, where they barely saw each other since they don't like to work in the same room. In the evening, after a day that caused them an extreme level of fatigue, Joana remembered a magazine she had of cocktail recipes for them to make and abstract themselves. While Joana is getting ready to make dinner, Bernardo is putting together the ingredients for the cocktails. With his eyes on the magazine, Bernardo notices an advertisement in the corner of the page. An app that seems to open doors to new sexual experiences and interactions in a playful and even competitive way, he comments with Joana and they both download the app to try it after dinner. Already more relaxed after the meal, they make their way to the app. They notice that before they can try the games and activities they have to pair their accounts. As they do so, the app asks for an important date of their relationship, which they enter the date they met. So Joana and Bernardo take the first step of many towards what will become a better, healthier sex&nbsp;life.                            </p>

                                Joana takes advantage of the fact that Bernardo is on a business trip to explore her body with the help of the app. Following the audio‑guides given by the app, she gets to know points of pleasure of her body that, until then, were unknown to her. Then she redeems the points she earned for a random romantic coupon, in which she buys a massage from Bernardo. Bernardo picks up his cell phone to read the notification he received, smiling, knowing that when he gets home he will have a special moment with&nbsp;Joana.                            </p>

                                Bernardo has been craving a walk by the beach. In order to get Joana a coupon from the Kiosk, Bernardo decides to do a few rounds of Demystify in hopes of getting the missing points. While playing, he realizes that he is, in fact, quite mistaken when it comes to matters of Sexology. After a few rounds, Bernardo not only manages to collect the necessary points for the coupon, but he also becomes much more informed and starts commenting on some curiosities with Joana, taking advantage of this and acquiring a Date Card&nbsp;coupon.                            </p>

                                Bernardo noticed that the app offered a quiz:“What's your sex toy”; he found it interesting and decided to answer. In the process of answering the quiz, Bernardo became even more interested in the topic of sex toys, when he saw the result he thought it would be a good opportunity to know Joana's opinion on the subject. In conversation, Joana showed fear for the fact that it is a high price and they may not like it, however, Bernardo reminds her that there is a discount coupon for a Sex‑Shop in the Kiosk. Although the coupon costs a lot of points, they decide to work together to get them, using the Sensate Focus exercise, since it is a cooperative activity. Given that this is a prolonged exercise, it nevertheless has a high reward, not only in terms of points for the coupon, but also in terms of positive consequences for the&nbsp;relationship.                            </p>

                                On a Saturday afternoon after lunch, Bernardo and Joana are on the balcony sunbathing while they relax. Being the weekend, there is a new Bingo rotation, and it is never too late for a good healthy competition between a couple. Joana starts checking off some of the activities, and notices that perhaps if she had shown more love during the week through certain activities, she could have completed more items, getting a more complete game card for the week. Bernardo, on the other hand, left only a couple of items uncompleted, staying ahead of Joana and earning the full Lovers' Bingo points. Seizing the spirit of the competitive mode, Joana wants revenge. Pouring herself a glass of wine, she challenges Bernardo to participate in rounds of “Risk or Spill”, through which they reveal things they had never told one another, while also performing challenges that elevate the relationship both on a romantic and sexual&nbsp;level.                            </p>

                                Bernardo opens the app and notices that the suggested conversation topic for today is about sexual fantasies. During the lunch break, he takes the opportunity to ask Joana if she has any fantasies that she has never revealed to him. While they have lunch they share their desires and reflect on what they would both like to&nbsp;try.                            </p>

                        We began by exploring themes related to sexuality, which inspired a brainstorming session that ultimately led us to our final concept. The idea we developed is an app where users earn points through games and activities, either solo or with a partner. These points can be exchanged for a variety of cards – romantic, sexual, or activity‑based – that can be sent to their partner as a fun, interactive way to enhance their&nbsp;relationship.                    </p>
                                    <p>
                        In addition, we introduced co‑operative games and activities designed for couples to earn a second type of shared points. These points can be redeemed for vouchers, such as discounts for sex shops or hotel stays, offering couples opportunities to enjoy intimate experiences&nbsp;together.                    </p>

                        The first step in designing the app was to create wireflows, which mapped out the user navigation across various screens through low‑fidelity&nbsp;sketches.                    </p>

                        Once the user flow of the application was defined, a low‑fidelity prototype was created with more detail than the wireflows. After conducting user testing, a high‑fidelity prototype was developed, incorporating insights from the tests. A final round of testing allowed for the last iterations to be made to the Anathema&nbsp;prototype                    </p>

The instructions for the \u201cLover&#039;s Bingo\u201d game were clarified to explain that when two phones are placed together, they create a single shared board rather than functioning separately. Additionally, a \u201cCustom Card\u201d option was added to the Kiosk, allowing users to personalize their experience further.&quot;,&quot;table&quot;:[[&quot;Participants&quot;,&quot;Relationship Duration&quot;],[&quot;T &amp; J&quot;,&quot;4 months&quot;],[&quot;F &amp; S&quot;,&quot;6 years&quot;]]}]'

Instructions were refined to better explain the horizontal phone placement in multiplayer games. In \u201cLover&#039;s Bingo\u201d, we clarified filled vs. unfilled blocks and assigned unique colors to players for better identification. To improve navigation, the confusing \u201cRisk or Spill\u201d cross button was replaced with a \u201cFinish button\u201d, and a \u201cBack to Home\u201d button was added to the final game cards to encourage users to fully review it before exiting.&quot;,&quot;table&quot;:[[&quot;Participants&quot;,&quot;Relationship Duration&quot;],[&quot;DI &amp; G&quot;,&quot;1 year and 6 months&quot;],[&quot;T &amp; I&quot;,&quot;1 year and 8 months&quot;],[&quot;F &amp; D&quot;,&quot;9 years&quot;],[&quot;J &amp; R&quot;,&quot;6 months&quot;],[&quot;A &amp; P&quot;,&quot;6 years&quot;]]}]'

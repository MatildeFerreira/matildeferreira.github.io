                        <em>afeiçoa-te</em>’s main focus is to ensure conscious and responsible adoptions through a two‑phase process. Phase one assesses the adopter's capability to adopt, while phase two matches them with animals fitting the adopter's profile. Moreover, the app educates adopters comprehensively, preparing them to care for their forever companion.                    </p>

Associations are overcrowded and unable to answer to the demand of wandering animals that need rescue (<a href='https://www.publico.pt/2021/02/20/p3/noticia/ha-animais-orfaos-faltam-maos-ajudar-1951475'>Lusa, 2021</a>). Adoption not only gives an abandoned animal another chance, but also allows the animal shelters to free a space that can be occupied by another animal in&nbsp;need.                    </p>

                        If in Portugal the pandemic crises increased animal abandonment, the lockdown and its solitude also led to an increase in adoption requests (<a href= 'https://www.jn.pt/nacional/pedidos-para-adotar-animais-dispararam-com-a-pandemia-12140959'>Costa A., 2020</a>). Therefore, there is an increase in the interest of the portuguese population to adopt&nbsp;animals.                    </p>

                                She wants to add a cat to her family, but she never had a pet and doesn’t know what it implies. She wants to adopt, and not shop but isn’t familiar with the adoption&nbsp;process.                            </p>
                                                    <p>
                                Leonor talked with her parents about her wish to adopt and convinced them to accept a cat in their family. Leonor’s parents don’t mind paying the costs inherent to having a pet, but are still&nbsp;apprehensive.                            </p>

                                She isn’t looking for specific characteristics in the cat and doesn’t exclude the possibility to adopt an animal with disability or disease. However, she doesn’t want an aggressive cat, that isn’t sociable, since she doesn’t have any experience and doesn’t believe she’s fit to integrate it with her&nbsp;family.                            </p>

                                Through friends, Leonor found the social media of some associations, however she doesn’t want to limit herself by visiting just a few animals. She believes that when she adopts her cat, it will be because she felt a strong emotional&nbsp;connection.                            </p>

                        To ensure consistency, the homepage maintains a uniform structure throughout the adoption process, with the only variation being the action triggered by the main button and its label, which adapts according to the user’s current adoption&nbsp;phase.                    </p>

                        Furthermore, it was understood that <b>the decision to choose an animal can’t be made inside the application</b>. The main reason for that is that the user needs to have an opportunity to meet the different animals in person before making a&nbsp;decision.                    </p>

The question reads 'Estás consciente de que a adoção é um compromisso para mais de uma década?' (Are you aware that adoption is a commitment for more than a decade?). Below the question, there are two button options: 'Sim' (Yes), and 'Não' (No). A progress bar at the bottom indicates that this is question 1 of 15.

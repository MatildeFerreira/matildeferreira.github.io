                        The <em>2SMART</em> website was the central platform for the project’s communication. It provided a comprehensive overview of the project, detailed information on each of its five activities, and showcased the four exhibitions resulting from Activity 5. A database of project results, with a filtering search system, facilitated easy access to the project’s&nbsp;outcomes.                    </p>
                                    <p>
                        The website integrated the project’s established visual identity, employing the <em>Saira</em> font family and its gradient color palette from vibrant pinks to&nbsp;purples.                    </p>
                                    <p>
                        To further enhance the project's narrative, 3D abstract illustrations were thoughtfully designed to visually represent each&nbsp;activity.                    </p>
